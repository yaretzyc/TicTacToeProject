## User Stories
As a user I want to: 
- Add X or O in the square
- I want to see which player won
- A restart button to redo the game
- Hover over the square to add the X or O
- See the scores of each player

## Development Progress
I started with HTML and then CSS files and did a simple board with a display of grid and centered the divs. I then worked mainly in JavaScript to get Player X started and then Player O to hover over a box and place their symbol in the box. The restart the game button was created in the HTML doc to let player redo the game. I used a for loop to assign each Winning Combination (winningComb) array to x, y, and z.

I restyled in the CSS setting the board to black and the container to white. I set the body to color yellow. Originally I had light colors but didn't really like the color combinations.

## Future Improvements

A few considerations to improve the functionality of the game:

- Player scores tally up with each game played
- Be able to restart the current game but the tally stays
- Audio plays when clicking the square and after a player wins
- An option for each player to choose their symbols
