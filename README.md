## User Stories
As a user I want to: 
- Add X or O in the square
- I want to see which player won
- A restart button to redo the game
- Hover over the square to add the X or O
- See the scores of each player

## Future Improvements

A few considerations to improve the functionality of the game:

- Player scores tally up with each game played
- Be able to restart the current game but the tally stays
- Audio plays when clicking the square and after a player wins
- An option for each player to choose their symbols
